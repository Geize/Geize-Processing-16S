# **16S rRNA analysis pipeline**

<br/>

The propose of this page is the reproducibility of the 16S data described in my publications (e.g.,<a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.00199-20">Tomazetto et al.</a>) or those are coming up soon. If you are looking for a tutorial, <a href="https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/"> here</a> is the best one you can have.

However, you are more than welcome to reach out to me if you need help. Do not worry, I won't jump into your work. But I'll be glad if you can cite one of my works as a reference. ðŸ˜Š


<br/> All the best for us! ðŸ¤“
