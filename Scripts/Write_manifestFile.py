Create a manifest_file.txt from any directory - I hope that!

1. Type on your terminal: python Write_manifestFile.py $PWD/
2. Open the file named as manisfest_file.txt.
ðŸ”¥ The output file == "manifest_file.txt". Do not change it.

3.Is there any line with word 'ERROR' written?
4. No. Great! It worked pretty well. ðŸ˜…
5. But if you find the "ERROR", please back to your directory and check your fastq.gz files.
   It is not my fault.

    My  script is considering:
        - You have Forward (R1) and Reverse (R2) files.
        - If you are not working with paired-end sequences... uhhh it won't work.
        - Your fastq.gz files are similar to the "Sample01_R1.fastq.gz".
